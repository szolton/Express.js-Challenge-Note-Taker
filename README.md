# **Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

The purpose of this project was to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve data from a JSON file.

The goal is to build the back end, connect to the front end, and deploy the application to Heroku.

Sources: My sources for this exercise were google, tutoring sessions and office hours.

I followed the resources to connect the front to the back end, here's a small screenshot of the app in action:

I added a server.js file and connected the front to back end. A lot of issues I ran into seemed to be easily fixible, I kept getting the same errors but then refreshed/cleared cache/restarted the server and that got everything working fluidly.

In conclusion, I set up to connect the front and back end, and deploy the finished version to Heroku. I:
- open the Note Taker, and can see a landing page with a link to the notes page
- you're presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left hand column, plus empty fields for a new note/title etc
- you can enter a new note title, and note's text, then hit the save note button and clear form appear in the navigation at the top of the page
- the new note button on the top of the page appears in the navigation, and you're presented with new blank fields to enter a note title and the note's text in the right-hand column where the button disappears
