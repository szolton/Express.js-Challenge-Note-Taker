# **Express.js Challenge: Note Taker

The purpose of this project was to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve data from a JSON file.

The goal is to build the back end, connect to the front end, and deploy the application to Heroku.


Sources: My sources were tutoring sessions and office hours.

I followed the resources to connect the front to the back end.

In conclusion, I set up to connect the front and back end, and deploy the finished version to Heroku. I:
- open the Note Taker, and can see a landing page with a link to the notes page
- you're presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left hand column, plus empty fields for a new note/title etc
